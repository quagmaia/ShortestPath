I know my project has some problems; it's too slow to check 25000.txt, and with 1000.txt its answer is too small. When I ran through my program with some of my own personal tests that were much smaller, things worked perfectly. I don't know if there is a problem with the logic of my code that makes bugger inputs wrong, or if I somehow misinterpreted what the assignment is. 

As for making my program more efficient, I am not sure what to try. 

I would say my problem is about 80% complete. Maybe less if my design was so terrible that to fix it, I would have to redesign form the bottom up--hopefully that's not the case! :)
